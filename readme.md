### Number window chart generator

This tool is used to generate random digits that are used with a sliding window to create a whole number of a specific number of digits.
For example, a row contains `8 1 5 2 3 1 4 5 4 6 7 3 8` and a 3 digit sliding window is put at the leftmost position of this row, then the student should say `eight hundred and fifteen`.
